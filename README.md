# ImageAestheticAssessmentPyTorch

Image Aesthetic Assessment in PyTorch with implemented popular datasets and models (possibly providing the pretrained
ones).

Note that this is a work in process.

## Supported Datasets:

- [AVA Datasets](http://refbase.cvc.uab.es/files/MMP2012a.pdf) A large-scale database for aesthetic visual analysis. It
  contains:
    - over 250,000 images, 235556 (training) and 19926 (testing)
    - aesthetic scores for each image
    - semantic labels for over 60 categories
    - labels related to photographic style
- [AADB Datasets](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fowlkes/papers/kslmf-eccv16.pdf) A aesthetics and attributes database
    - 10,000 images in total, 8458 (training) and 1,000 (testing)
    - aesthetic scores
    - meaningful attributes assigned to each image (*TODO*)
- [CHAED](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/356.pdf)(*TODO*)
